Transposable Element Scraper and Removal Tool.

Version 1.1 - 2/16/2020 Now takes multiple fasta files. An additional command line argument has been added to specify the specific chromosome you wish to splice from the repeatMasker file. Format should be relative to the repeatMasker file (ie. chr21 for <em>Homo sapiens</em>).
